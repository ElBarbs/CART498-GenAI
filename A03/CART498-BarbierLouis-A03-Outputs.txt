Ahoy matey! Seems like me thinkin' planks be shorter than me ship's pennantâ€”I've gone and made a dog's breakfast of that calculation! Crikey! I'll rewrite me number map and give it another burl, or I'll be walkin' the plank meself! Avast ye, here's hopin' I don't bollocks it up again!

Ahoy matey, it seems I've hit the mathematical reef and bungled the numbers like a landlubber! Let me swab the decks and give it another go, savvy? Blimey, if I keep this up, I'll have to turn in me eyepatch and quit me day job as a calculator! Let's try this again before the octopus of embarrassment wraps its tentacles around me pride! Arrr!

(7, 4):
Ahoy matey, it seems this salty sea dog made a miscalculation! I must've counted me own toes instead of the numbers ye gave me. Even a blind wombat could've seen that mistake comin'! Let me give that another whirl fer ye.
