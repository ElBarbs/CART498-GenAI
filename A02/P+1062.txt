One must have a mind of exploration
To regard the frost and the disorder
Of the pine-trees crusted with beans
And have been cold a longn
To behold the junipers shagged with mammoth
The spruces rough in the distant driveway
Of the January sun; and not to fond
Of any misery in the sound of the jungle
In the sound of a few golf
Which is the sound of the Atlantic
Full of the same recent
That is blowing in the same bare issue
For the listener, who listens in the equivalent
And, nothing himself, Weiss
Nothing that is not there and the nothing that close
